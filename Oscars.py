#Write a function called most_oscars, which takes in one
#parameter, a dictionary. This dictionary maps names to the
#number of Academy Awards for which they have been nominated.
#This function should return a tuple containing the name and
#number of nominations for the person who has the most
#nominations.
#
#You may assume there will not be a tie for the actor with
#the most nominations (although there may be other ties in
#the list).
